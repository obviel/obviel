CHANGES
*******

1.0b4 (unreleased)
==================

* the autocomplete widget was not sending 'change' events correctly when 
  the autocomplete field received the 'blur' or 'close' event. With previous
  jQuery versions this was okay, but this broke with jQuery 1.7.x.

1.0b3 (2012-12-06)
==================

* Switch to the Buster.JS test framework and the Sinon.JS mocking
  library. See :doc:`the development documentation <development>` for
  more information.

* obviel-forms now uses Bootstrap_ CSS classes. If Bootstrap CSS is included
  on a page, the forms will render with pretty form widgts.

  .. _Bootstrap: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

* Removed js.obviel Fanstatic_ packaging. Instead moved this to a
  `separate project`_, just like other Fanstatic projects.

  .. _`separate project`: https://bitbucket.org/fanstatic/js.obviel

* Make ``option:value`` configuration within JSON-Templates possible.
  (using ``fromString`` instead of using the ``Template
  constructor``). You may need to upgrade to the latest version of
  JSON-Template (now included in ``src/dependencies``) to make this
  work.

* Upgraded JSON-Template in ``src/dependencies`` to the latest version
  (0.85).
 
* Beginnings of Obviel Sync. This is as yet undocumented and
  incomplete, but the goal is to allow the developer to define
  declaratively how client models (and UI updates) interact with the
  server models.

1.0b2 (2012-07-19)
==================

* **GREAT RENAMING**: this one breaks backwards compatibility! Any
  names previously using under_scores now use camelCase, to better
  follow JavaScript conventions. This means your previous Obviel code
  will break. In particular:

  * ``html_url``, ``jsont_url`` and ``obvt_url`` are now ``htmlUrl``,
    ``jsontUrl`` and ``obvtUrl``.

  * ``object_events`` becomes ``objectEvents``.

  * API functions are also camel-case now, i.e. ``registerFormatter``
    instead of ``register_formatter``.

  * Form field names are now camel-case, so ``inputField``, ``textlineField``,
    ``textField``, ``integerField``, ``floatField``, ``decimalField``,
    ``booleanField``, ``choiceField``, ``displayField``, ``hiddenField``,
    ``datapickerField``, ``autocompleteField``.
    
  * ``validationUrl`` instead of ``validation_url`` for forms.

  * ``maxLength``, ``minLength``, ``maxLength``, ``allowNegative``,
    ``minBeforeSep``, ``maxBeforeSep``, ``minAfterSep``,
    ``maxAfterSep``, ``emptyOption``, for widgets.

  In general you can straightforwardly translate under_score to
  camelCase everywhere. 

  There are a few exceptions. ``_`` is of course still to mark
  translations. Constants such as ``NAME_TOKEN`` also keep the
  underscore. We also recommend that if you have a variable named
  after a translation domain (i.e. ``en_US``) you keep the underscore
  as well. Finally in Obviel template it is still used to refer to
  special variables when you loop through a dotted name
  (i.e. ``{@each.something_persons.number}`` if you are looping
  through ``something.persons``.

  If you use Emacs you can translate the underscores to camelcase in a
  file automatically, using the following command::

    M-x replace-regexp
    Replace regexp: \(\w\)_\(\w\)
    with:           \1\,(upcase \2)

* Backwards compatibility: ``$(el).render(obj)`` now returns a jQuery
  promise. This is a more modern alternative for the ``callback``
  argument. To track whether a view is done rendering you can hook in
  with ``.done``. The ``callback`` argument has been removed, breaking
  backwards compatibility. You can rewrite::

    $(el).render(obj, function() { this.el });

  to this::

    $(el).render(obj).done(function(view) { view.el });


  A view is only considered done rendering (its promise will be
  resolved) when all its ``data-view`` sub-views have been resolved too.

* Backwards compatibility: previously when you implemented ``render`` in
  a view, it could optionally receive a number of arguments ``(el, obj, name,
  callback, errback)``. ``callback`` and ``errback`` have been removed. 
  ``el``, ``obj`` and ``name`` have been available already on ``this``,
  and these are the preferred way to access them.

  This change also affects the ``cleanup`` method; if you implement it, it
  will not receive the ``el, obj, name`` arguments anymore.

* Unfortunately ``<element>``, ``<attribute>`` and ``<block>`` did not
  work well in IE. Instead you can now use ``data-el``, ``data-attr``
  and ``data-unwrap`` on any DOM element.

* Introduce ``data-handler`` directive to hook up events directly from
  template. With Obviel, this will hook up events to view directly.

* The template constructor now accepts templates that consist of
  multiple elements on top ("<p>first</p><p>second</p>"). It also
  accepts templates that are a piece of text and an element following
  ("text<p>following</p>") or are an element followed by a piece of
  text ("<p>first</p>followed").

* Templates can be inlined in a ``<compilerName>Script`` section 
  in the HTML document.
 
* Fix a bug in ``data-id`` generation where ``data-id="not_a_variable"``
  wasn't correctly handled.

* Change Obviel to be compatible with jQuery 1.7.2. There were two issues:
 
  * Obviel relied on document-level event handlers to be triggered
    even for disconnected events.

  * Obviel Forms used a cargo-culted pattern for sending 'change'
    events; replaced this with shorter el.trigger('change').

* While Obviel may continue to work with older jQuery versions for a
  while, we're going to target jQuery 1.7.2 now for our testing.

* the json2 dependency, which takes care of JSON generation
  compatibility for Internet Explorer, has been moved to the
  dependencies directory out of the Obviel directory; this is where it
  belonged all along.

* Formatters and funcs can now be more flexibility plugged into Obviel
  Template, just like translations and event handlers. Obviel core
  makes use of this by looking up formatters and funcs on the view
  first, then if it cannot be found there, in the global registries.

* Improved i18n infrastructure for translations. See the :doc:`i18n
  documentation <i18n>` for more information.

* Pluralization support both in JavaScript and in Obviel
  Templates. See :doc:`i18n documentation <i18n>` for more
  information. 

* use Pygments to highlight HTML and JavaScript snippets properly
  in the docs.

* Rewritten compiler loading and caching infrastructure. Caching has been
  generalized and improved. Also helps prepare for better template error
  reporting.

* When an error happens during Obviel template rendering the exception
  will be logged to the console with location information to help with
  debugging.

* You can optionally return a jQuery promise from a view's ``render``
  method.  If you do, subview rendering and view rendering completion
  waits until that promise is resolved.
  
* When there is a CompilationError or RenderError in an Obviel
  template, log error on console detailing iface, template and xpath
  in template where error occurred.
 
* Added missing API docs for :func:`element.rerender()`,
  :func:`element.view`, :func:`element.parentView()` and
  :func:`element.unview()`.

* Use mockjax for cleaner AJAX testing.

* Remove pyobviel, obviel-datatables and obvielts. These were unfinished
  and can always be resurrected at some point in the future.

* the ``src`` attribute is like the ``id`` attribute special in that
  it may not be directly used with variables in a template. This is
  because an image ``src`` for instance is directly loaded as soon as
  the template is parsed, and this does not work with variables and
  will result in a network error. Instead we force the developer to
  use ``data-src`` to set the ``src`` attribute, just like we force
  the developer to set ``data-id``.

* ``traject`` is now placed in the ``obviel`` namespace for
  consistency with the other modules. It can still be used
  stand-alone, however.

* Fixed a bug where data-view could not be used with URLs.

* Changed documentation theme.

* Updated documentation for clarity in various areas.

1.0b (2012-05-31)
=================

* Added Obviel Template language implementation. This replaces
  JSON-Template as Obviel's preferred template language. Obviel Forms
  makes use of it internally. Obviel Template supports features such
  as sub-views and i18n. See the :doc:`Obviel Template documentation
  <template>` for more detail.

* :doc:`i18n documentation <i18n>`: how to do i18n with Obviel.

* Added Traject library. This library allows routing of paths to
  objects and the inverse: constructing paths for objects. See the
  :doc:`Traject documentation <traject>` for more detail.

* Added ``transformer`` hook. This allows Obviel to transform content
  it retrieves from the server using URLs and hyperlinks.

* Added ``object_events`` structure, allowing you to declare events on
  the object the view is rendering. Also introduce ``rerender`` method
  on view.

* Added ``before`` hook to views. You can now pass a ``before``
  function when configuring a view. This function will be called
  before rendering (including before template rendering). This is useful
  to manipulate ``this.obj`` to add extra information before the template
  is rendered.

* Obviel Forms now uses a special view for the iface
  ``obviel_forms_error_area`` to render error areas. You can define a
  view and render your own error area. In this view create an element
  with id ``this.obj.field_error_id`` to hold the field error message,
  and an element with id ``this.obj.global_error_id`` to hold the
  global error message.
  
* Obviel Forms now sends an event soon as an error message is set or
  cleared. The event names are ``field-error.obviel-forms``,
  ``field-error-clear.obviel-forms``, ``global-error.obviel-forms``,
  ``global-error-clear.obviel-forms``. The events are sent to the
  element on which the error message is rendered, and will bubble up
  (so you can catch them on a higher level). The ``target`` property
  of the event will also have a reference to the element on which the
  message was set.

0.11.1 (2012-01-14)
===================

* Last release changed the obviel forms translation domain from
  ``obviel_forms`` to ``obviel-forms``, but forgot to adjust the forms
  code to take this into account.

0.11 (2012-01-13)
=================

* Added js.obviel Fanstatic_ integration.

* Added Python-based obvielts test server for testing Obviel with a
  "live" test server.

* Included jslex_prepare script to help with i18n process. See updated
  ``doc/i18n.txt`` for notes.

* Updated translations to include support for obviel-forms-datepicker and
  obviel-forms-autocomplete.

.. _Fanstatic: http://www.fanstatic.org

0.10 (2011-11-04)
=================

* Obviel models may now have an ``iface`` or an ``ifaces`` property,
  but not both. ``ifaces`` may be a string instead of an array. This
  makes the common mistake to make a model object with ``iface`` not
  a mistake anymore.

* Update test dependencies to newer version of jQuery and jQuery-ui.
  These are also used by the demo code. Made it so that the version
  number of dependencies not in the URL anymore, so that it's easier
  to update in the future.

* Included datatables as a dependency, though haven't integrated
  code using it yet.

* Add Obviel patterns ``multi``, ``event`` and ``redirect`` to
  new ``obviel-patterns.js``. See the pattern demo page in the
  documentation for a demo of these.

* Integrate support for simple jGrowl messages in
  ``obviel-jgrowl.js``; see the pattern demo page for examples.

* Reorganized directory structure: everything, including tests and demos 
  are in 'src' now, which in turn is included in the documentation so we
  can link to demos (and its dependencies) from there.

0.9.1 (2011-11-03)
==================

* Include form demo in documentation.

0.9 (2011-11-02)
================

Initial public release.
