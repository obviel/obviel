Traject: routing for JavaScript
===============================

Introduction
------------

.. sidebar:: maintaining an object structure

  Traject assumes that your application maintains a structure of 
  JavaScript objects in the browser in which to look up paths. This
  may not be the way in which an Obviel application is constructed.
 
  We are considering two possible additions to Obviel to help with this:

  * an object synchronisation system so to help the user maintain an
    object structure on the client, and also update the user interface
    accordingly.
  * asynchronous resolution of paths, so that a lookup function can
    make an AJAX request to the server in order to retrieve an object
    just in time.

  Please let us know on the :ref:`mailing list <mailing list>` if you
  have a need for these facilities.

Obviel includes the ``obviel-traject.js`` library. Traject is a
library for resolving paths to objects. It is not dependent on Obviel
itself, just on jQuery, but is intended for use with Obviel.

In some JavaScript applications you want to display the user interface
as a single page that never reloads, but you still want to support
hyperlinks, the back button and bookmarking.

For this you can use the `fragment identifier`_. The fragment identifier
is the text behind a hash (#) mark in the URL::

  http://example.com/something#the_fragment_identifier

The fragment identifier can change without the web browser forcing a
reload of the page, for instance when the user clicks a hyperlink to
another fragment identifier (``<a
href="#another_fragment_identifier">Click</a>```), or when the user
presses the back button in the browser.

.. _`fragment identifier`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier

A JavaScript library like `jQuery BBQ`_ can be used to subscribe to
changes in the fragment identifier (``hashchange`` in jQuery BBQ) and
take appropriate action.

.. _`jQuery BBQ`: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/

What is this action? The fragment identifier is held to be
identifying, somehow, some JavaScript object that the client has
available. We want to get this object, and then render it in the
content area of the UI. When the fragment identifier changes, we want
to update the content area of the UI with this rendered object.

Let's look at these steps in more detail:

1. we receive fragment identifier change event (a library such as 
   jQuery BBQ).

2. interpret fragment identifier as a *path* to find an object (
   using Traject).

3. render object on content area in UI (using Obviel views).

With Traject you can define a patterns registry with path
patterns. You can then use this patterns registry to resolve actual
paths to objects.

The Idea in Code
----------------

Let's translate this into some code::

  $(document).ready(function() {
    // we render an application object when this
    // page first loads. we have defined the app view
    // to include a div with the id "content"
    $('.app').render(app);

    // trigger the initial hash change manually using BBQ, it goes
    // to the empty fragment identifier, "#"
    $(window).trigger('hashchange');
  });

  // listen to the BBQ hashchange event
  $(window).bind('hashchange', function(ev) {
    // we interpret the fragment identifier as a path to an object
    var path = ev.fragment;
    // resolve the path to obj using a traject patterns registry we have
    // defined before
    var obj = patterns.resolve(app, path);
    // render the found obj using Obviel
    $('#content').render(obj);
  });

With this code, hyperlinks to fragment identifiers and the back button
will work: when you click a link or press back, the content area in
the UI will change accordingly, just as if you were browsing to a new
web page.

This code is not complete: you need to define an ``app`` object, a
view to display the ``app`` object and views to display whatever
objects are found using ``patterns.resolve``. What these views are is
completely up to the application. We'll see examples of an ``app``
object later.

But most importantly, we haven't described how to create a
``patterns`` registry with Traject in the first place, and what it can
do for you exactly. Let's look at this now.

A Patterns Registry
-------------------

The main object defined by traject is :class:`obviel.traject.Patterns`. If
you include traject in the page you can create one like this::

  var patterns = new obviel.traject.Patterns();

Now let's look at a simple scenario where we use the simplest form
of a path pattern: a single name. We define a bunch of objects::

  var app = {
     iface: 'app',
     objects: {
        a: {iface: 'A', 'title': 'the A object'};
        b: {iface: 'B', 'title': 'the B object'};
        c: {iface: 'C', 'title': 'the C object'};
     }
  };
 
Now we want a pattern registry that gives back object ``a`` when the
path is ``a``, ``b`` when the path is ``b``, and, you guessed it,
``c`` when the path is ``c``.

Let's do it::

   var getA = function(variables) {
      return app.objects.a;
   };

   var getB = function(variables) {
      return app.objects.b;
   };

   var getC = function(variables) {
      return app.objects.c;
   };

   patterns.register('a', getA);
   patterns.register('b', getB);
   patterns.register('c', getC);

When we now resolve a path with the patterns registry, we will find the
appropriate objects::

  var root = {iface: 'root'};

  patterns.resolve(root, 'a'); // gives back app.objects.a
  patterns.resolve(root, 'b'); // gives back app.objects.b
  patterns.resolve(root, 'c'); // gives back app.objects.c

So, what you register with the patterns registry is a path (the first
argument) and a function to call when this path is matched. You then
resolve a path. We'll explain what the ``root`` object is for later,
but you also may have noticed the ``variables`` argument to the
``get`` lookup functions, which we'll go into next.

Variables in Paths
------------------

The code above was a bit repetitive given the regular nature of the
``app`` object. In addition, each time we add a new object to ``app``
with some new name (``d``, ``e``, ``foo``, whatever) we would have to
register a new path in the patterns registry so it can be found. We
can use this code shorter and more flexible by using a variable in the path
instead. Instead of the above registrations, we'll use this::

  var getObject = function(variables) {
     return app.objects[variables.name];
  };  

  patterns.register('$name', getObject);

Now we can look up paths with arbitrary names, and each will be
resolved to an object in ``app.objects``.

How does this work? Any variables in the path are indicated using a
dollar sign (``$``). The values of these variables will be passed into
the lookup function as properties of the ``variables`` object. The
function then uses these variables to identify and return the object.

Longer Paths
------------

Paths are not restricted to single names, you can also use the slash
(``/``) character in them::

  patterns.register('foo/bar/baz', getSomething);
  patterns.register('stores/$storeId', getStore);

Paths may also use multiple variables at the same time::
  
  patterns.register('stores/$storeId/products/$productId');

Both ``storeId`` and ``productId`` will be passed into the lookup
function as properties of the ``variables`` object.

Name and Parent
---------------

When a path is resolved to an object using traject, the object is placed
in a virtual hierarchy that is deduced from the path. For instance,
when we look up an object like this::

   var root = {iface: 'root'};
   var obj = patterns.resolve(root, 'a');

``obj`` will be placed within the ``root`` object. This is done by
adding two properties to ``obj``, ``trajectName`` and ``trajectParent``.

``trajectName`` is the name the object was looked up under, in this
case ``a``. ``trajectParent`` is the object that is placed under, in
this case ``root``. So these are true::

  obj.trajectName === 'a'
  obj.trajectParent === root

You can also construct deeper paths. Consider a registration like this::

  patterns.register('foo', getFoo);
  patterns.register('foo/bar', getBar);

When we now retrieve ``foo`` and ``bar`` using the following code::

  var root = {iface: 'root'};
  var foo = patterns.resolve(root, 'foo');
  var bar = patterns.resolve(root, 'foo/bar');

the following will be true::

  obj.trajectName === 'bar'
  obj.trajectParent === foo
  foo.trajectName === 'foo'
  foo.trajectParent === root

This works with variables too::

  patterns.register('departments/$departmentId', getDepartment)

  var department1 = patterns.resolve(root, 'departments/1');

  obj.trajectName === '1'
  obj.trajectParent.trajectName === 'departments'
  obj.trajectParent.trajectParent === root

Here we've registered the path ``departments/$departmentId``, but we
have not registered ``department``. So what kind of object is
``obj.trajectParent``? It's a special default object that traject
creates if it doesn't have any more specific lookup function
registered for that path::

  { iface: 'default'}

You can specify a custom default object lookup with a patterns
registry if you want::

  patterns.setDefaultLookup(function() {
    return { iface: 'someCustomDefaultObject'};
  });

Converters
----------

In some cases it is convenient to have a variable be converted to a
particular type, for instance an integer automatically. You 
can do this by indicating the converter behind the variable::

  patterns.register('customers/$customerId:int', getCustomer);

The ``variables`` object passed to the ``getCustomer`` function will
now get the variable ``customerId`` as an integer. If a non-integer
is in the path for ``$customerId``, the path will fail to resolve.

You can also register new converters with the patterns registry::

  patterns.registerConverter('float', function(value) {
     var result = parseFloat(value);
     if (isNaN(result)) {
       return null;
     }
     return result;
  });

You can now use a variable definition with ``:float``, such as
``$customerId:float``.

Inverse: Locating Objects
-------------------------

So far we've considered looking up an object for a path, using
``resolve``.  Traject also supports the inverse scenario: given an
object, reconstruct what path it has. More generally, we are able to
*locate* an object using traject. To locate an object means it has a
``trajectParent`` and ``trajectName``, and following the
``trajectParent`` chain will eventually lead to the root object.

To help traject locate an object, we need to register an inverse
function of the lookup function. A lookup function looks up an object
given a set of variables. The inverse of that creates the variables
given an object.

Let's consider a simple scenario::

  var departments = {
    alpha: { iface: 'department', title: 'Alpha'},
    beta: {iface: 'department', title: 'Beta'},
    gamma: {iface: 'department', title: 'Gamma'}
  };

  var getDepartment = function(variables) {
     return departments[variables.departmentName];
  };  

  patterns.register('departments/$departmentName', getDepartment);

We now need to create a function that given a department object, gives
back its name (``$departmentName``), in a ``variables`` object like this:
``{departmentName: 'the name'};``. 

How do we find the name of a department in ``departments``? We can loop
through it until we find the department we want the name for, like this::

  var getDepartmentVariables = function(department) {
     for (var departmentName in departments) {
        if (department === departments[departmentName]) {
            return {departmentName: departmentName};
        }
     }
  };

Now we can register the inverse function::

  patterns.registerInverse('department', 'departments/$departmentName',
                            getDepartmentVariables);

Now we can locate a department object::

  patterns.locate(departments.alpha);

Once we've located the department, it will have a ``trajectParent``
and a ``trajectName``. Locating an object is especially good to
reconstruct its path, which can be useful to help construct links in
the the user interface. To construct the path for an object (and automatically
locate it first if necessary), you can use ``patterns.path``::

  var path = patterns.path(root, departments.alpha);

to get the path ``departments/alpha`` back.

Registering Lookup and Inverse Together
---------------------------------------

In many cases you'd like to register the lookup and inverse at the same
time. You can do this using the ``pattern`` method::

  patterns.pattern('department', 'departments/$departmentName', 
                   getDepartment, getDepartmentVariables);
